# I Ching Modified 3 Coin Method

This is the source I published to https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=I_Ching_divination&action=edit&section=18

I do not agree with the publishing of the 3 coin method due to the Sung Dynasty error of using 3 coints.  In fact, many years ago I modified the Wiki and they finally have a page on the probability and methoid as above.  I then found out they have a 3 coin method software.  I think as water and mind flow to the easiest method, I better once again try to publish a better version.  I do include the original 3 coin method as some may like it.

The painfully slow yarrow-stick 18 changes method is not yet ready.

Also, the 2 hexagram need to amended to be based on proper version. There are many I would stick to a few option like this.
